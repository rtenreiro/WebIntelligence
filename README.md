From Coursera course

I am doing a coursera course on bigdata where there is a programming assignment.
This repo stored my homework.
The HWÂ·3 is to write a parallel map-reduce program for the h3data task using mincemeat.py the implementation written in Python.

 1. I put a copy of mincemeat.py in my Python directory (C:\Python27) 

 2. I created a file called count.py in my Python directory (C:\Python27) using the suggested code on the class and I added import re and
 import Counter as a new code to fit the task.

 3. I opened two command prompts and I navigated to my Python directory (cd C:\Python27) 

 4. In the first command prompt I used: python count.py

 5. In the other command prompt I used: python mincemeat.py -p changeme localhost
 
 6. It created the file outF.txt that I opened in word.
